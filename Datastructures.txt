Binary Trees:
the data structures of type tree comes in many forms .however the binary tree is a bit special because when they are in the sorted form
they facilitate quick search ,insertion and deletion .items can be accessed ,inserted or deleted in any order.each sub tree is itself a tree.tree related programmings ned not always resursive.non recursive tree programming is also possible.but mush harder to code.
binary tree transversal:
Inorder tree transversal:first left sub tree followed by root and finally right sub tree.
pre order transversal:root is visited first followed by left sub tree and last right sub tree.
post order transversal:first left sub treee followed by right sub tree and last root.
it needs a sorted form.
depth first transversala: we transvese a single path of tree  as far as we can.
